# Beginner Java

This project contains solutions for several simple tasks for beginners in Java programming

## Description 

Before I learned how to write automated tests in Selenium, I had to go through the basics of Java programming. Through the course at ITBootCamp, I gained the necessary knowledge, and every day, as homework, we had several simple tasks for which we needed to write solutions through code. This project in each class contains the task description and its solution.
